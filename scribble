## My initial thoughts:
server          --  client
make socket     
                    connect to socket
see client
send data   
                    receive data
                    send data   
receive data 


## stuff to remeber:
connected datagram sockets
unconnect datagram sockets

udp/tcp/...

select function indicates which of the specified file descriptors is ready for reading

## website server and client interaction
Client          Server
                socket
                bind
                listen      
                accept
                //blocks until connetion
socket          |
connect -connection estabishment
write           |
                read
                //porcess request
                write
read
close   
                read 
                close
